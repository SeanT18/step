                <p>This picture is a reaction that I like to use a lot to things I'm speechless for. The pure confusion on this face resembles my my thoughts whenever I'm confused on things. I also use images and if you'd ever like to send
                me memes or photos like this email me at setisdale@google.com. :)  </p>

                <p>This picture was from when I went to seattle for the first time. I was only there for a day due to business purposes but it was a great experience because I've never been 
                on the west coast before. In fact i'm one of the very few people in my family who actually have been to the west coast. I also had gelatto for the first time here but sadly I don't have any pictures of that. </p>

                <p>This was from this school semester. Me and a group of people participated in a hackathon at our school and were able to win second place! It was my third hackathon ever and we won Oculus Go's.
                The people in these photos are my good friendsand the person to the left of me has actuallybeen my mentor since freshman year.</p> 
                <p>FUN FACT: I still haven't opened the box to the Oculus yet and I don't know when I will.</p>
