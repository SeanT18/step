            <p>Hello!! My name is Sean Tisdale, welcome to my personal webpage :D. I am a Computer Science major who atttends North Carolina A&T University and I am from Charlotte NC. I first got into Computer Science when I was in High School.
                During my junior years my school introduced a lot of new courses to take. Some of the ones I took were Computer Programming, Photoshop, and video game design. From these 3 courses I took over the school years 
                computer programmming intereted me the most. After completing the course I did research and saw all of the things someone could do with computer science which always made me interested 
                because sticking to one thing forever was always boring to me.I am currently mostly interested in databases and AI in computer science. hobbies I have are playing games, watching anime or tv,
                and eating. I am currently trying to get into cooking more but it's a process so I'll give it time before calling it a hobby. </p>
