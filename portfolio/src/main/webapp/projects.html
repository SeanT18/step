            This project was a warm-up for a workshop that gave training on making android apps. This 
            simple applications function was changing the colors of text when a button was pressed.</p>

            This was the actual project I worked on after the warm-up app above. This flascard application's function was presenting a question. When the question was clicked on a answer to the question would appear.
            User's had the option to create their own questions and scroll thriough or delete other questions they create. This project was a my first time really going into depth with android studio and it was fun!
            This was also my first time using transition on android studio and using some type of datbase to remember the user's previous question and answers. </p>

            This is a project from my first semester freshman year. It was a tic tac toe game and it was also my first time working on a project ever. I did this with two other people who were also freshman. It was a great experence and if I were to 
            do this again I would use 2D arrays. During the time of making the game we didn't know how to do that so we made 8 arrays.</p>
